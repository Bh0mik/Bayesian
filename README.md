# Bayesian Statistics Project

In this Project, I have borrowed partial codes(functions) for both California House Price prediction model to check the uncertanity in the data using 
Prior and Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). 
So, What is Prior and Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC)? 
  Prior predictive checks are also a crucial part of the Bayesian modeling workflow. Basically, they have two main benefits:

  ```
   * They allow you to check whether you are indeed incorporating scientific knowledge into 
   your model â€“ in short, they help you check how credible your assumptions before seeing the data are.

   * They can help sampling considerably, especially for generalized linear models, 
   where the outcome space and the parameter space diverge because of the link function.
 ```
For the second part which includes neural network prediction and analysis, we ran three different neural network models 1).  Neural Network Model 
2). Bayesian Neural Network Model 3). Bayesian probabilistic Neural Network.

  ```
  * The object of the Bayesian approach for modeling neural networks is to capture the epistemic uncertainty, 
  which is uncertainty about the model fitness, due to limited training data.

  * The idea is that, instead of learning specific weight (and bias) values in the neural network, the Bayesian approach 
  learns weight distributions - from which we can sample to produce an output for a given 
  input - to encode weight uncertainty.
