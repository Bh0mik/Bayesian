# Bayesian Statistics Project

In this Project, I have borrowed partial codes(functions) for both California House Price prediction model to check the uncertanity in the data using 
Prior and Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). 
So, What is Prior and Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC)? 
  Prior predictive checks are also a crucial part of the Bayesian modeling workflow. Basically, they have two main benefits:

   #They allow you to check whether you are indeed incorporating scientific knowledge into your model â€“ in short, they help you check how credible your assumptions before seeing the data are.

   #They can help sampling considerably, especially for generalized linear models, where the outcome space and the parameter space diverge because of the link function.
